about-author: Iâ€™ve been in Information Technology consultancy and management since 2002 wearing many hats since then such as being a senior engineer, running a field team, running a project management office, process improvement manager, and a director of service delivery.  I have a passion in all things automation and absolutely love making technology do things that were once done by a human.  I am currently exploring Azure and recycling of plastics with my kids. # add description
