When I first started this blog, I created it in GoDaddy as a Word Press blog because I really didn't know what I was doing and I wanted to learn what it took to run a site.  Admittingly I lost touch with it and eventually got rid of the hosted portion while keeping the domain name.  I then decided that I wanted to restart my efforts on writing so I decided to point my DNS to Wix and run the site from there.  Recently though, I have thought that I would like to learn how to run a site using technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, containers, CI/CD pipelines.  I want to learn the technologies that are used today by DevOps engineers. 

I needed an idea of a website that I could test with.  I needed something to use as a platform to do my testing on and learn how it all works.  I decided that I would play with this very blog.  I searched to see how I could re-write the blog into my own technology stack and in the process learn more about all of the tech.
