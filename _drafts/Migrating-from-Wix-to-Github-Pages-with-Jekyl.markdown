I have a new topic today, Docker!  That's right Docker.  For those of you that do not know who or what Docker is well lets take the current definition from Wiki.

<blockquote>
    Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
